This project exemplifies the co-design of firmware/hardware.

Firmware developers are assumed to be familiar with the book "Hardware/Firmware
Interface Design: Best Practices for Improving Embedded Systems Development" by
Gary Stringham published in 2009.

Examples are drawn from the Rockbox firmware MP3 player project [1]. In particular,
inspiration was found in the iAUDIO power management firmware [2] that targets the
PCF50606 data sheet [3].

Note that no attempt is made to capture the entire complexity of firmware
development. Instead, the emphasis is on engineering principles that embrace
the interface design between firmware and hardware models in SystemC.

Thus, three common firmware/hardware (FW/HW) use cases are illustrated:

* FW reads HW register
* FW writes HW register
* HW interrupts FW

To run the example, you need to install SystemC [4].

As always, any feedback or questions is appreciated.

Enjoy,
Alex
